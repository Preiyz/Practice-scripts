In the stillness of the night,
As the stars shine bright,
I close my eyes and take a breath, 
And feel my worries start to rest. 

The moon above casts a gentle glow, 
As the cool breeze starts to blow, 
I'm reminded of life's simple joys, 
And the peace that nature employs. 

In this moment of calm and grace, 
I find my soul in a peaceful space, 
And I'm grateful for this chance to be, 
Alive and free, just like the sea.
